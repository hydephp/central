## Analytics

HydePHP uses two types of analytics and statistics collection; both of them completely anonymous and tracker free.

**We never collect any personal data, and we never sell any information.**
In fact, our analytics data is [public](https://analytics.hydephp.com)!

### Cloudflare Web Traffic

Cloudflare provides us with basic DNS-level analytics and statistics, showing us what countries we receive top traffic from,
and what the amount of traffic in total per hour. **We have no way of tying any of this data to any specific user.**

### Open Analytics Database

Our custom Open Analytics Database ([analytics.hydephp.com](https://analytics.hydephp.com)) aggregates data from various sources.
**None of this data can be tied to any specific user.**

We receive data from the following third party sources:

- GitHub repository traffic
- Packagist Installations
- Cloudflare Web Traffic

We also collect the following data ourselves:

- Test run statistics (for our custom Continuous Integration platform ([ci.hydephp.com](https://ci.hydephp.com)))
- API Requests and Page Views for the Analytics platform.*

*<small>These track both the total number of visits, and unique visits using an anonymization algorithm that makes it
impossible to tie the unique user to any other activities due to the use of a dual-salt mechanism containing both
a server secret and a dated string into a hash that is by design useless for other purposes.</small>
